## HEAVY MAT
A memory intensive matrix class with fast matrix multiplication

## Files
Samples folder contains images with flexible basis technique applied at various maximum error levels <br />
Samples_SVD folder contains image with SVD technique applied to save same # of mults as corresponding images in samples folder <br />
SVD_Matrix.h, SVD_Matrix.cpp, SVD.h, SVD.cpp, and Vector.h are adaptations of code originating online (source listed below) to do singular value decomposition on square matrices <br />
M.png, arches.png, north.png are the three images used for the poster.  We also analyzed sign.png but it was not used in our poster <br />
