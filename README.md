## HEAVY MAT
A memory intensive matrix class with fast matrix multiplication

### Remaining Tasks
 * Get performance metrics on Strassen for various sizes of matrices
 * Get performance metrics on heavy multiplication for random data, normal data, M logo, and some other picture (maybe something michigan related like a picture of the union as that may be pretty symettrical)
 * Get performance metrics on naive multiplication for all the sizes gathered above, for comparison sake
 * Finish implementing heavy multiplication method 
 * Consider reworking algorithm to focus on producing fewest product linear combinations by more intelligently picking "basis" or somehow have a flexible basis
 * Generate some images with varying levels of error
 * Get performance metrics on generated images with heavy mulitplication
 * Get performance metrics on generated images with naive
